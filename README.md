<p align="center">I don't currently have the motivation to make a real repository here yet. The one I made on my CRK account took all my brain juice. And then a bunch of shit happened that makes it really hard to get through each day without a shit ton of distractions, including youtube videos, people-watching while afk-ing on ponytown, listening to music, playing CRK, trying to make friends on the stupid pony app, etc.</p>
