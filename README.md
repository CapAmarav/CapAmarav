<p align="center">Hobbies include watching youtube videos, listening to music, playing HSR, writing fic ideas, people-watching while sitting on ponytown, making skins on ponytown, and trying to make friends on the pony app.</p>

<p align="center">BYI: don't be weirdly sexual to me or my skins or assume any ships with me.</p>

<p align="center">if I'm sitting alone and my boundaries don't disclude you (e.g. if you're in the same fandom as my skin and/or you would like to sit as a ship I don't hate) PLEASE keep me company please please please I'm lonely and love cuddles and I would never bite someone who affords me that kind of simple platonic affection (friends and acquaintances get first priority, strangers please ask to sit with me unless I have open c+h before doing so since I attract weirdos and freaks sometimes 😭),</p>

<p align="center">if I'm sitting with someone I probably won't move so anyone who wants to chat me will have to whisper (or just walk up and talk to me if I happen to not be afk idc)</p>
