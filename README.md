<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p align="center">Hobbies include watching youtube videos, people-watching while sitting on ponytown, listening to music, playing CRK, playing HSR, and trying to make friends on the pony app.</p>

<p align="center">BYI: don't be weirdly sexual to me or my skins, I'm still recovering from a breakup (with someone I adored and did not want to end things with) and hate shallow shit,</p>

<p align="center">if I'm sitting alone and my boundaries don't disclude you (e.g. if you're in the same fandom as my skin and/or you would like to sit as a ship I don't hate) PLEASE keep me company please please please I'm lonely and love cuddles and I would never bite someone who affords me that kind of simple platonic affection,</p>

<p align="center">if I'm sitting with friends I probably won't move so anyone who wants to chat me will have to whisper (or just walk up and talk to me if I happen to not be afk idc)</p>
